DNA Motif Finding Algorithm Implementation
Implemented a comprehensive suite of bioinformatics algorithms focusing on DNA motif discovery. The project features three distinct approaches: Brute Force for exhaustive search, Median String for pattern matching, and Gibbs Sampling for probabilistic motif detection. Each algorithm is equipped with specialized scoring functions and Hamming distance calculations for sequence comparison.
The implementation includes sophisticated data visualization utilizing matplotlib, enabling comparative analysis of algorithm performance metrics, execution time distributions, and convergence patterns. The Gibbs Sampling implementation specifically features iterative refinement with configurable parameters, while the helper functions facilitate efficient DNA sequence manipulation and scoring.
Key technical aspects include algorithm time complexity optimization, statistical performance evaluation, and dynamic motif evaluation using consensus sequences. The project demonstrates practical applications of computational biology concepts while maintaining code modularity and reusability.
